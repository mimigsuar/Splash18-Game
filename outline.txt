No mainmenu! 
2 or 3 types of enemies
Player
bullets

(show opengameart/freesounds)

Scripts: 
Will start working on demo!

Generic:
middleclass.lua - for OOP.
vec2.lua - for math things.
collision.lua - will write in class to demonstate maybe. 

Game Specific:
player.lua - contains code for the player 
player_bullet.lua - contains code for the player's bullet
enemy.lua - generic parent for all enemies, teach inheritance. 
game.lua - contains the code the glues together the enemies, player, objects, etc. It's all managed from here.
enemy1.lua - enemy follows the player.
enemy2.lua - enemy that moves in a straight line, and sometimes shoots at the player.
enemy3.lua - complex enemy that will follow the player, but attempt to dodge bullets.
